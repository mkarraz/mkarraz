## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matias Karraz. Welcome to my personal repository!

Telecommunications Engineer with a strong background in network and communication systems management. My professional trajectory has focused on optimizing and enhancing telecommunications infrastructures, providing me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and teamwork.

Currently seeking an exciting transition into the field of Information Technology (IT), specifically as a backend-oriented full-stack developer. With JavaScript as my primary language within the Node.js environment (though not limited to it), I strive to learn more about technological development each day.

My goal is to be part of a dynamic and creative team where I can leverage my engineering experience and enthusiasm for software development. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to take on new challenges in the field of information technology.
